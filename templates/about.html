        <h3>What We Do</h3>
        <p>
            Our platform gives users an estimate of used car price based on data and various considerations. Advanced machine learning algorithms are used to examine historical information from many automobile manufacturers in order to allow for greater precision in predictions. Some of the factors included in our model are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Car Brand and Model:</strong> Car make and model often determine how much it sells for. Historical facts help us realize the way various brands and models depreciate over time.</li>
            <li><strong>Year of Manufacture:</strong> In addition to other things, age is also important in setting value for cars. Normally older cars have less worth than younger ones, but again maintenance or repair condition affects them too.</li>
            <li><strong>Kilometers Driven:</strong> Mileage as a function of kilometers determines the status of any automobile and hence its price. Generally, it has been seen that more mileage results to less value.</li>
            <li><strong>Fuel Type:</strong> Moreover, the value of automobiles depends on their different fuel types i.e. Petrol, Diesel or Electric ones. Such kind of differences are taken into consideration by our model.</li>
            <li><strong>Transmission:</strong> As an illustration, a manual transmission versus automatic can have impact with respect to car’s market value.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How this website Works</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Input Your Details:</strong> Car brand, model, year of manufacture, kilometers driven, fuel used and type of transmission are the simple details that users fill in the form.</li>
            <li><strong>Model Prediction:</strong> Our machine learning model trained on this data forecasts car prices. The model is developed using enormous data from popular brands including BMW, Mercedes Benz, Ford and Toyota.</li>
            <li><strong>Get Your Estimate:</strong> Within seconds, the users get an estimated price that gives them a true picture of how much the car is supposed to cost according to current data trends.</li>
        </ol>

In regard with age or use of particular vehicles, it determines their cost based on historical records and patterns. This design constantly assimilates and modifies itself over time to achieve more precise predictions.
